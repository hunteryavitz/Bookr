Vehicle Appraisal Application

This simple application allows the user to create a vehicle project by entering attributes of the vehicle, which is then appraised through a bluebook calculator,
and then generated into a dynamic sales ad.  It has save/load functionality and uses the GUI components from javax.swing package.  It is modeled after MVC design pattern
and also incorporates singleton design pattern as well as factory design pattern.  It stores and retrieves data from files using the fileReader through a data access
object.  It generates the sales ad through a parsing mechanism and pre-written text file.

Use Launch.java as the entry point.

All files are free to download/edit/use in anyway anyone sees fit.
